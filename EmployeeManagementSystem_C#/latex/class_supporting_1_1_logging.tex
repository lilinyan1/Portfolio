\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is called upon in order to audit (or track) the usage , status and outcomes of many of the other class libraries methods. 

logging class will use \hyperlink{class_supporting_1_1_file_i_o}{File\-I\-O} class to access log files \par
 The following events should be logged\-: \par
         -\/ in any case, once a record is read and parsed from the incoming file, the \hyperlink{class_supporting_1_1_logging}{Logging} class is used to record this event – this logging event would indicate if the record just parsed generated a valid employee-\/type or not \par
         -\/ include a summary event when this is done indicating the total number of records read, total number valid and total number invalid \par
         -\/ include a summary event when this is done indicating the total number of records written, total number valid and total number invalid \par
         -\/ any file\-I\-O related errors \par
         -\/ Anytime an attribute is attempting to be set, but is invald – log the attribute name and invalid attribute value \par
         -\/ When the Validate() method is called – log the employee’s name (last\-Name, first\-Name) and social\-Insurance\-Number values as well as whether the object is valid or not \par
         -\/ When the Details() method is called – log all employee details in the same format as that being displayed on the screen into the log file \par
